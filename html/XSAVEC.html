<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Performs a full or partial save of processor state components to the XSAVE area located at the memory address specified by the destination operand. The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state components saved correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap (RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and XCR0.</p>
<p>The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.</p>
<p>Section 13.9, “Operation of XSAVEC,” of Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 provides a detailed description of the operation of the XSAVEC instruction. The following items provide a highlevel outline:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Execution of XSAVEC is similar to that of XSAVE. XSAVEC differs from XSAVE in that it uses compaction and that it may use the init optimization.</li>
	<li>XSAVEC saves state component i if and only if RFBM[i] = 1 and XINUSE[i] = 1.1 (XINUSE is a bitmap by which the processor tracks the status of various state components. See Section 13.5.4, “Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State.”)</li>
	<li>XSAVEC does not modify bytes 511:464 of the legacy region of the XSAVE area (see Section 13.4.1, “Legacy Region of an XSAVE Area”).</li>
	<li>XSAVEC writes the logical AND of RFBM and XINUSE to the XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE header.2,3 (See Section 13.4.2, “XSAVE Header.”) XSAVEC sets bit 63 of the XCOMP_BV field and sets bits 62:0 of that field to RFBM[62:0]. XSAVEC does not write to any parts of the XSAVE header other than the XSTATE_BV and XCOMP_BV fields.</li>
	<li>XSAVEC always uses the compacted format of the extended region of the XSAVE area (see Section 13.4.3, “Extended Region of an XSAVE Area”).</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of a destination operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (in either 64-bit or 32-bit modes) results in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.</p>
