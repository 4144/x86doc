<p>Fetches the line of data from memory that contains the byte specified with the source operand to a location in the cache hierarchy specified by a locality hint:</p>
<table>
<tr>
	<td>••••The source operand is a byte memory location. (The locality hints are encoded into the machine level instruction using bits 3 through 5 of the ModR/M byte.)If the line selected is already present in the cache hierarchy at a level closer to the processor, no data movement occurs. Prefetches from uncacheable or WC memory are ignored. The PREFETCHh instruction is merely a hint and does not affect program behavior. If executed, this instruction moves data closer to the processor in anticipation of future use. The implementation of prefetch locality hints is implementation-dependent, and can be overloaded or ignored by a processor implementation. The amount of data prefetched is also processor implementation-dependent. It will,however, be a minimum of 32 bytes. It should be noted that processors are free to speculatively fetch and cache data from system memory regions that are assigned a memory-type that permits speculative reads (that is, the WB, WC, and WT memory types). A PREFETCHh instruction is considered a hint to this speculative behavior. Because this speculative fetching can occur at any time and is not tied to instruction execution, a PREFETCHh instruction is not ordered with respect to the fence instructions (MFENCE, SFENCE, and LFENCE) or locked memory references. A PREFETCHh instruction is also</td>

T2 (temporal data with respect to second level cache)—prefetch data into level 2 cache and higher. Pentium III processor—2nd-level cache. Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors—2nd-level cache. NTA (non-temporal data with respect to all cache levels)—prefetch data into non-temporal cache structure and into a location close to the processor, minimizing cache pollution.
