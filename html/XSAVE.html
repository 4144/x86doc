<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Performs a full or partial save of processor state components to the XSAVE area located at the memory address specified by the destination operand. The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state components saved correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap (RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and XCR0.</p>
<p>The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Soft<em>w</em>are Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.</em></p>
<p>Section 13.6, “Operation of XSAVE,” of <em>Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1</em> provides a detailed description of the operation of the XSAVE instruction. The following items provide a high-level outline:</p>
<ul>
	<li>XSAVE saves state component <em>i</em> if and only if RFBM[<em>i</em>] = 1.<sup>1</sup></li>
	<li>XSAVE does not modify bytes 511:464 of the legacy region of the XSAVE area (see Section 13.4.1, “Legacy Region of an XSAVE Area”).</li>
	<li>XSAVE reads the XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE header (see Section 13.4.2, “XSAVE Header”) and writes a modified value back to memory as follows. If RFBM[<em>i</em>] = 1, XSAVE writes XSTATE_BV[<em>i</em>] with the value of XINUSE[<em>i</em>]. (XINUSE is a bitmap by which the processor tracks the status of various state components. See Section 13.5.4, “Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State.”) If RFBM[<em>i</em>] = 0, XSAVE writes XSTATE_BV[<em>i</em>]with the value that it read from memory (it does not modify the bit). XSAVE does not write to any part of the XSAVE header other than the XSTATE_BV field.</li>
	<li>XSAVE always uses the standard format of the extended region of the XSAVE area (see Section 13.4.3, “Extended Region of an XSAVE Area”).</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of a destination operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (in either 64-bit or 32-bit modes) results in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.</p>
