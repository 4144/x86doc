x86doc
======

I needed a parsable copy of Intel's x86 instruction set documentation for a
personal project, so I downloaded volumes 2A and 2B of the *IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer's Manual* (which can be found [here][1] and
[here][2], respectively), and used a online PDF-to-HTML tool to transform them
to HTML files.

The result was beyond terrible and absolutely unusable.

To fix that, I made a Python script with [`BeautifulSoup`][3] to extract in bulk
the documentation for each instruction and write it to cleaner HTML files. There
are still some issues:

* Nested lists are broken;
* Figures simply can't be translated correctly.

Even then, this is significantly more useful, so I'm publishing it in case
anyone needs it. Most of what's missing will probably have to be dealt with
manually.

The files can be viewed at [felixcloutier.com/x86][4].
