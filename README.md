x86doc
======

I needed a parsable copy of Intel's x86 instruction set documentation for a
personal project, so I downloaded volumes 2A and 2B of the *IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer's Manual* (which can be found [here][1] and
[here][2], respectively), and used a online PDF-to-HTML tool to transform them
to HTML files. Unfortunately, the result was beyond terrible and absolutely
unusable.

They say that you're never better served than by yourself, so I took the matter
into my own, [pdfminer][3]-gloved hands to extract HTML pages straight from the
documentation PDF themselves.

*This branch is experimental.* Right now, it parses about 415 of the 470ish
instructions documented in Volume 2A and Volume 2B. Complex pages usually (but
not always) render better with this branch than the `master` branch, but not all
pages render. Be sure to check out the `master` branch if you want something
immediately usable.

The current documentation set can be found on [this page][4].
